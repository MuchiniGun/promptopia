## Promptia by Muchinigun

This is my first NextJS tutorial that I did following JSMastery's YouTube video(https://youtu.be/wm5gMKuwSYk).
Although it was based off a youtube video, I first tried to do most of it on my own and using NextJS, NextAuth as well as MongoDB's guides on their sites. Where I got stuck I would refer back to the video.

This project also gave me a great idea for a variation project that I will make. I will also post the github repo for it once I'm done with it.
